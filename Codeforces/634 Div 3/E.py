# Unsolved.
# I tried using Counter from collections to get the most_common() pairs in descending order. The idea was that the longest 3
# block palindrom xxxxyyyyxxxxx would be found in here. But unlike C.py where the most common element is part of the answer over 
# here that is not the case. a = 111113332333. Here, the longest 3bp is of length 7: 3332333 which does NOT contain the most common
# element. Hence, I could not build on this further. Lastly, finding the # of occurence of the second most common elem ''in between'' the first most common or vice-versa was very vague for me to formulate a solution.

# Alternate solution
