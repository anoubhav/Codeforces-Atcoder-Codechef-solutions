# 54 mins with 10 submission errors. This was terrible from my side. With 50 point penalty for each wrong submission.

# Editorial solution
def editorial():
    # O(N)
    # Intuition: If there is ANY prefix or suffix sum which is negative/zero, Adel can completely ignore those elements and take the remaining array as the segment. As remaining array has sum â‰¥ the sum of the whole array. 
    # So, if that's the case, the answer is "NO".

    # Otherwise, all the segments that Adel can choose will have sum < than the sum of the whole array because the elements that are not in the segment will always have a strictly positive sum. So, in that case, the answer is "YES".
