## Intended solution
# If the number consists of other primes than 2 and 3 then the answer is -1. Otherwise, let cnt2 be the number of twos in the factorization of n and cnt3 be the number of threes in the factorization of n. If cnt2>cnt3 then the answer is -1 because we can't get rid of all twos. Otherwise, the answer is (cnt3âˆ’cnt2)+cnt3.
