# Overall Intuition: Basically all the numbers which fall in the range of [k*lcm, k*lcm + max(a,b)) (k is any integer) have equal moduli. If l or r falls in the middle of such a range, the numbers either have to be included or excluded which is handled in these two statements.

# I arrived at this by printing values of the statement for x:1 to 100. So that was smart of me. I got the algorithm but the number theory tripped me.

            ### I couldn't find the number of occurences of [LCM, LCM + max(a, b)] in [l, r]. I figured out the algorithm in 20 mins. But, I spent **1 hr 10 mins** on trying to implement the above line, i.e., # of occurrences. Pathetic.
